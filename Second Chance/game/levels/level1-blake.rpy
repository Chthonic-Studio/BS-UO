    death "Ah, how the powers that be conspired together to bring you here"

    "No introduction is needed, everyone present felt it the moment they were aware of the entity's presence, they were in fron of Death itself. A woman with skeletal features, whose voice rippled like spines of ice, cutting through the air with a chill."

    death "I hold no joy of meeting you here in my domain, as for I would have rather spoken with you when your hair was gray and your memories of life far away, but alas, Fate has arranged for us to meet here in my abode"

    death "You, my dear children, have made the transition to the world of the dead, brought forth by none other than your own hands."

    "With Death's words, the realization of mortality sweeped over them."

    death "You are now in Limbo, the realm between the living and the dead"
